## Preface

This browser is written in python because it has an extensive universe of libraries, and a built-in cross-platform UI framework (tkinter).

The initial goal is to understand the algorithms that are used in a browser without carrying to much about handling all errors that a faster and safer language would need, like C/C++/Rust.

I want to actually create this browser in Rust after I finish this first Python version.
